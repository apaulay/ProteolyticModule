# Proteolytic Module for _Bacteroides caccae_ Metabolic Model

This repository contains scripts and resources for developing and implementing a proteolytic module in a _Bacteroides caccae_ ATCC 43185 metabolic model.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to enhance the _B. caccae_ metabolic model growth and metabolic production prediction accuracy by incorporating a proteolytic module. The proteolytic module allows for protein breakdown and provides a more comprehensive representation of the organism's metabolic capabilities.

## Dependency

- MATLAB: Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system to run the scripts and perform the simulations.

- [CobraToolBox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox.git): The CobraToolBox, a MATLAB-based toolbox, is required for working with the B. caccae metabolic model and performing FBA simulations.

- Homemade Scripts: In addition to the CobraToolBox, several homemade scripts were developed specifically for this project. These scripts modify the functionality of the CobraToolBox and provide additional custom features.

## Usage 

### Optimization: 

- Optimization: optimize the exchange reactions' lower and upper bounds using an in vitro training data set using a GLM and a P20 in silico media. The optimization allows to obtain a parametrized _B. caccae_ metabolic model.

```matlab
optimisation
```

Output: optimized _B. caccae_ metabolic model ready to be used for dynamicFBA 

Requirements: parameters files (list) 

### Perform dynamic Flux Balance Analysis: 

- Dynamic FBA Simulation: the modified dynamic FBA function incorporate additional regulations for improved growth and metabolic production prediction accuracy. dFBA analysis is performed on 3 different media (GLM, P2 and P20)

 - Comparison with laboratory data:

```matlab

```

Output: 

Requirements: parameters files (list)
